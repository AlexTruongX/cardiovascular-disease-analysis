## Cardiovascular Disease - Case Study Analysis
In this project, I investigate the major causes of death in the world within the past century, analyzed data from the Framingham Heart Study (an observational study into cardiovascular health), examined the effects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of coronary heart-disease for post-menopausal women using data from the Nurse's Heart Study and Heart and Estroge-Progestin Replacement Study. Lastly, I explored the effects that consumption of saturated fats has on cardiovascular death rates using data from the National Heart-Diet Study. 

**Languages:** Python
